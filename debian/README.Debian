As of xfwm4-4.0.0+cvs.20031901, the behaviour of Xfwm4 has changed.
In order to move it into background (aka "daemon mode"), appending
& to the program call won't work anymore. You should pass --daemon
to xfwm4 to start it in daemon mode. Please change your local config
files to reflect these changes.
